## Synopsis

MetaDiff is a Java/R-based software package that performs differential expression analysis on RNA-Seq based data. By utilizing a meta-regression framework, it is also readily capable of incorporating covariates other than experimental group. This makes it extremely easy to adjust for parameters that might influence a subject's transcriptome when performing differential expression analysis.

## Motivation

When performing differential expression analysis, often one wishes to adjust for parameters other than experimental group. For example, the age and gender of a subject might
